      "question": "What is the main idea behind spaced repetition?",
      "options": [
        "Reviewing information at increasing intervals to boost retention",
        "Reading material quickly multiple times",
        "Studying all material in one long session",
        "Focusing only on new information each time"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Spaced repetition is designed to review material at increasing intervals to align with the brain\u2019s natural forgetting curve."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the spacing effect?",
      "options": [
        "Learning is best done in one long study session",
        "Reviewing material frequently with no breaks is optimal",
        "Information is better retained when study sessions are spread out over time",
        "Immediate repetition leads to long-term memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The spacing effect shows that spreading out study sessions helps memory consolidate better over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does spaced repetition save time compared to traditional study methods?",
      "options": [
        "You study only once per topic",
        "It eliminates the need for reviewing altogether",
        "It focuses reviews only when you're about to forget the material",
        "You can skip hard topics"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Spaced repetition reduces wasted effort by targeting reviews right before you're likely to forget something."

    {
      "question": "What is one recommended tool for using spaced repetition effectively?",
      "options": [
        "Canva",
        "Google Docs",
        "Anki",
        "Slack"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Anki is a popular app that uses spaced repetition algorithms to schedule optimal review intervals automatically."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should you adjust your review intervals as you become more familiar with the material?",
      "options": [
        "Review less often at first, then more frequently later",
        "Maintain the same interval regardless of memory strength",
        "Increase the interval between reviews as recall improves",
        "Stop reviewing once you've seen the material twice"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Spaced repetition increases the time between reviews as your memory strengthens, maximizing efficiency and retention."
